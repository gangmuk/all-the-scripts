request="Rewrite and improve this story: Well, I have always liked helping people since I was a small child, I have been accused many times of giving too much away for free, but I find joy in helping others put the pieces together to reach their goals. As a Licensed Professional Counselor and Life Coach that is my job to impact individuals and help clients work through emotional difficulties and reach goals. But I will be honest with you I was selling the dream but not always living the dream. I had issues I had not worked completely through like childhood trauma, heartbreak, disappointments, and frustrations with life. Don't get me wrong I had the husband, the kids, the house and the 6 figure job but I was not happy inside, but I didn't change because I hate change, most of us hate change, right? Then I lost my sister, my friend, and it slapped me in the face that I need to take care of myself. I saw the addiction, I saw her not taking care of herself and I could not save her. One thing I know for sure, if you do not make your wellness a priority illness will find you. I remember the moment we lost her, the earth stood still and then my heart broke into pieces, what was I going to do, I have loved her my whole life! It was months later that I made a decision that I would be the change I hope to see, I would create a space for women of color to move past the obstacles that keep us from creating the life we want and Brown Suga Wellness was born. I am on this journey and I invite you to be on this journey with me! I love this quote by Oludara Adeeyo: 'When you heal yourself, you create an earth shattering legacy. The lineage of women who come after you will be healed. Your inner circle of Black women around you, healed.' When you choose yourself you break generational trauma and curses. You activate your ancestral strength. I invite you to activate that strength!"
